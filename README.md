# McStasScript-notebooks
Jupyter notebooks using the McStasScript python package

## Tutorial
The tutorial folder has a McStas tutorial using McStas and a tutorial on using the McStas Union components.

## Quizes
Test your knowledge of the McStasScript package and McStas Union components in the two quizzes, McStasScript_quiz and Union_quiz. Each have a notebook with solutions as well. They both rely on the quizlib module included in this repo, so execute the notebooks from this folder.
